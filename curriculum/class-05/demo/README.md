# Demo: Bitmap Project

### Bitmaps  (`demo/bitmap-demo.js`)
  * Open the bitmap spec document first and talk through it
  * Write code to read in the bitmap as a buffer
  * Using the spec as your guide and the `readUInt16LE` functions, parse a few things out of the buffer, such as File Type, Height, Width
