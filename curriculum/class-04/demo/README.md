# Demos: Buffers

### Buffers  (`demo/buffer-demo.js`)
  * The demo file is pretty well commented.
  * This is all about creating a buffer out of a string and just messing with it
  * Demonstrate looping, getting char codes, changing chars
  * Demonstrate using the `readUInt16LE` functions from node to traverse and pull
